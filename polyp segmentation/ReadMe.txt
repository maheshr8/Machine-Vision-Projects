# Polyp Segmentation Model using UNet & PSPNet

Implementation of a deep learning-based polyp segmentation model. Polyps are precursors to colorectal cancer polyp detection is therefore important. The colonoscopy images are available at Simula Datasets - Kvasir SEG (Link - https://datasets.simula.no/kvasir-seg/). The Kvasir-SEG dataset (size 44.1 MB) contains 1000 polyp images and their corresponding ground truth from the Kvasir Dataset v2. The resolution of the images contained in Kvasir-SEG varies from 332x487 to 1920x1072 pixels. The images and their corresponding masks are stored in two separate folders with the same filename. Please download the kvasir-seg.zip folder for implementation.
